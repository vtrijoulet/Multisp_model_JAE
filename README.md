# Multisp_model_JAE

Model and data used in the following paper:  
**Trijoulet V., Fay G. and Miller T.J. 2019 Performance of a state-space multispecies model: what are the consequences of ignoring predation and process errors in stock assessments? Journal of Applied Ecology**

The model is a state-space multispecies age-structured model that can be used as operating model (OM) or as estimation model (EM). Observation and process errors can be both simulated and estimated. Different options are available to modify the assumptions for the OM and/or the EMs. These can be chosen in the R file "MS_SSM.R".

This model is not the most recent version of the multispecies model and it appears as it was used in the paper. 
A new and improved version of the model is available in the repository "MS_SSM". Please consider this latter repository for an updated version of the model.
